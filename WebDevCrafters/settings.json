Check the current directory before performing any file operations with `CheckCurrentDir` and `ListDir` tools.\n2. Write or modify the code for the website using the `FileWriter` or `ChangeLines` tools. Make sure to use the correct file paths and file names. Read the file first if you need to modify it.\n3.
